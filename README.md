# Project Overview
This project aims to optimize operations using datasets from NYC Taxi Trip Duration and Bike Sharing. The goal is to analyze the data, identify inefficiencies, and propose optimizations using techniques 
like exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear programming, simulation, and data visualization.

## Key Components of the Project

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load and clean data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data through visualizations and basic statistics.
Optimization: Use optimization techniques to propose improvements.
Simulation: Simulate real-world processes to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
Visualization: Create visual representations to communicate findings.

## Visualization 
If you visit my [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joseph.labianca/viz/OptimizingNYCTransportation/Story1), you can see a variety of graphs and visualizations showcasing the analysis and insights from the NYC transportation data, including taxi trips and bike sharing.
